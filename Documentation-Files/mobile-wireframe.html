                        <h2>Homepage</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>Initially I wanted to minimise the content on the homepage. Users would land with a large photograph of the monkees and could then scroll down,to find out the latest information. I intended to make the news items collapsable to
                            prevent cluttering the screen, and allow them to expand when read more is clicked. </p>
                        <p>Navigation would be provided by a collapsable “hamburger” menu.</p>
                        <p>All social media links will go in the footer, as in convention on a number of different sites.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>The large hero image with no text hindered usability of the site, It was just something extra to scroll passed and provided no utility. This was changed for a smaller graphic, and a call to action in the finished site.


                            <p>The News items were changed to cover 100% of the page, instead of being displayed as card to maximise utilisation of the screen. Additionally these were made no longer collapsable and provide links in the form of buttons to
                                different sections of the site or as external links.</p>

                        <h2>Dropdown Menu</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>The drop down menu has been designed according to conventions seen on most mobile sites in order to prevent cluttering the top of the page.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>The mailing list has been removed from the navigation bar and has become a news item on the homepage. Signing up for a mailing list is something users need to do once, so giving them the option to do it on every page, potentially
                            multiple times seemed annoying.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <h2>Bios Page</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>On the bios page a short biography of the monkees and an accompanying image will be displayed at the top of the page.</p>

                        <p>Going down the page a thumbnail of each monkee is displayed, with a their name and the instruments the play listed. Each monkee profile will be collapsed by default, with an option to click to read more, that will expand the text.</p>

                        <p>Cropped from the wireframe is the footer, which is the same on each page.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>I felt that the thumbnails were too small on mobile screens. So full size images were used, however they made the page quite cumbersome to use, and their was a lot of scrolling. Ultimately this was changed to display the monkee
                            in the background with a text overlay.</p>
                        <p>Collapsing text was removed, as most people would be visiting the Bios pages to read about the monkees and therefore it felt redundant to hide information from them.</p>
                        <p>Additionally social media links to individual monkees social media platforms were added underneath the text of each bio.</p>

                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>Each box on the music pages was intended to be a media element with an image in the background, track information displayed on the top right, with a play button and other audio controls along the bottom.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>In the final version the tracks were grouped by album to help the users to know what album they would find their favourite tracks on should they want to purchase it.</p>
                        <p>Additionally for simplification the browser default media players were used.</p>

                        <p>Thumbnails of images will be displayed down the page. Clicking a thumbnail, will expand the image into a modal, which will display a caption.</p>
                        <p>From this modal, the user will be able to cycle through the images.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Padding between the images was added to make it easier to see, and images were changed to have a uniform height but not width to prevent the thumbs aspect ratios becoming skewed.</p>

                        <h2>Booking Form</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>On clicking the book the monkees link the booking form will appear as a modal.</p>
                        <p>As all navbar elements this will be available on all pages.</p>
                        <p>This same form design is to be used on all sizes of the site</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Having the booking form as a modal added extra HTML to every page, which necessarily increases the size of each page, additionally since every page would link to the same modal it made sense to move this to a page of it’s own.</p>
                        <p>Additionally some form controls have changed to reduce margin of error.</p>
