                        <h2>Homepage</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>At tablet size the navbar is shown in full and a monkees logo replaces the text on the right of the navbar.</p>
                        <p>The 4 next upcoming concerts will be displayed below the strapline, with links to buy tickets.</p>
                        <p>News items are displayed as cards 2x2 on the homepage. - the read more buttons will open the news item in a modal.</p>
                        <p>The sign-up for mailing list has been moved to the footer of each page out of the navbar.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>As with the mobile version i felt that having a large hero image just created an additional thing to scroll passed, instead of being a meaningful addition. A smaller image and call to action button added in its place. Finally the book the monkeys navbar item was changed to book us.</p>
                        <p>Strapline was removed and included with the aforementioned image and call to action.</p>
                        <p>SNews items have been changed to take up full width of the page, as it was more attention grabbing. Additionally they no longer open in modal window, instead basic info is provided buttons acting as links take users to the corresponding page.</p>
                        <p>Mailing list signup was removed from the footer, as discussed in the mobile homepage, it felt too much always asking the users to sign up.</p>

                        <h2>Bios Page</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>At the top of the page an image of the monkees is displayed. With a brief band bio underneath.</p>
                        <p>Down the pages each monkee is in a different coloured section, with picture and text alternating in position, to even further make them stand out from each other.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Social links were included below each Monkee bio. Other than that this page was largely unchanged.</p>

                        <h2>Music Page</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>The user will select a song from a list on left. When a song is selected the chosen song will play, the album cover will show in the box on the right, and information about the album cover will be displayed.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>At this stage in the course i did not possess the javascript ability required to create a design that functioned like this. </p>
                        <p>The final design used this format, but the image and audio links swapped position and each albums came one after the other vertically down the pages.</p>

                        <h2>Video Page</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>The videos are displayed down the page as thumbnails, clicking the video will replace the thumbnail with a video element that will play the requested video.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>As with the audio section, this had to be redesigned based on scope of this project. The large video player was ultimately removed and the video thumbs open the video in a modal.</p>

                        <h2>Gallery Page</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>As mobile, only using 3 columns. Tapping thumbnails opens them in a modal (full size with a caption) user can cycle through images using controls on that page. </p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Padding applied to thumbs, uniform height applied only so aspect ratio is maintained. This means that the rows vary in the number of pictures displayed.</p>
