                        <h2>Homepage</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>At desktop size the design is very similar to the tablet sized design. With some minor changes.</p>
                        <p>The sign up for the mailing list has been moved to an alert at the top of the page, above the navbar, to make it immediately eye catching to the users.</p>
                        <p>The news item cards will function in the same way as the do on tablet mode, with the content of the news item appearing in modals.</p>
                        <p>Newest Media releases have been included on the homepage as a means of quickly accessing the latest content.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>As with the other designs I felt that having a large hero image just created an additional thing to scroll passed, instead of being a meaningful addition. A smaller image and call to action button added in its place. </p>
                        <p>Mailing list signup was removed from the alert, as discussed in the mobile homepage, it felt too much asking the users to sign up.</p>

                        <h2>Bios Page</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>The bios page is largely unchanged from the tablet version, except the bios have been placed inside a container, and some page margins have been added..</p>
                        <p>Down the pages each monkee is in a different coloured section, with picture and text alternating in position, to even further make them stand out from each other.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Social links were included below each Monkee bio. Other than that this page was largely unchanged.</p>

                        <h2>Music Page</h2>
                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>The design of the music page was very similar to the tablet version, except with some margins and padding.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>For the same reasons as with the tablet version the design was altered. I used a similar design as shown left, with image and songs positions switched around and duplicated the image, tracks and info for each album, going down the page. </p>

                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>The design of the video page was very similar to the tablet version, except the thumbnails are all in one row.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>As with the audio section, this had to be redesigned based on scope of this project. The large video player was ultimately removed and the video thumbs open the video in a modal. The new design is based on the thumbs section of the tablet version, but with margins.</p>

                        <h3>The Design</h3>
                        <p>Exactly the same design as on tablet only with more padding between the images and margins at the edges.</p>
                        <h3>Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Padding applied to thumbs, uniform height applied only so aspect ratio is maintained. This means that the rows vary in the number of pictures displayed.</p>
